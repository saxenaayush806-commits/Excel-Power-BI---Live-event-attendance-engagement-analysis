# Excel-Power-BI---Live-event-attendance-engagement-analysis
Live Event Attendance & Engagement Analysis

This project is all about understanding how people show up and engage during live events. Using Excel and Power BI, I collected and analyzed event data to find patterns in attendance and audience interaction.

The goal is to turn raw numbers into clear, useful insights that can help organizers improve the overall event experience and make smarter decisions for the future.

ðŸ›  Tools Used:

Excel â€“ for cleaning and preparing event data

Power BI â€“ for creating interactive dashboards and visual reports

âœ¨ What It Does:

Tracks attendance in real time

Visualizes audience engagement in a simple, clear way

Compares event performance and highlights key trends

Makes it easy to understand what worked â€” and what didnâ€™t

ðŸŽ¯ Why I Built This:
To help event teams see beyond the numbers and focus on creating experiences that truly connect with their audience.
